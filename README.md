🧾 What I Learned

This bootcamp provided hands-on experience with the end-to-end data science workflow — from code collaboration and automation to scalable computation on HPC and cloud systems.
Key takeaways include:

Building reproducible ML environments using Conda, Docker, and Singularity

Leveraging GitHub and testing workflows for collaborative projects

Developing and debugging efficiently with VSCode and CLI tools

Utilizing NYU Greene HPC and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for large-scale computation

Managing containers and GPU jobs with Slurm and Singularity

💻 Core Topics
🧠 Data Science Stack

CLI & Shell Scripting: automation, variables, redirection

Environment Management: Conda, Mamba, and Docker

IDE Mastery: VSCode remote debugging and notebook integration

🧩 Git & Version Control

Version tracking, branching, and collaborative workflows

Resource: MIT Missing Semester – Version Control

🐍 Python Environments

Created isolated dependencies using environment.yml

Shared and reproduced consistent environments across systems

🌐 Remote Development

Configured SSH key authentication and ProxyJump

Connected VSCode and Jupyter to remote HPC or GCP instances

Used tmux, htop, and nvidia-smi for live performance monitoring

☁️ NYU Greene HPC & GCP Bursting

Accessed 550+ CPU and 60+ GPU nodes via Slurm

Deployed GPU workloads on GCP burst instances

Transferred data between Greene and GCP securely with scp

🧱 Singularity Containers

Built containerized environments for HPC without root privileges

Reused NVIDIA PyTorch / TensorFlow Docker images

Ensured consistent research environments across systems
